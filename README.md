# Credit Approval Prediction Analysis

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Account firms and banks need to automatize the credit qualification activity that is essentially dependent on data given by customers when rounding out an online structure. Sex, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Salary, Loan Amount, Credit History, and other such different subtleties are incorporated. “Approval of Loan is a very common real-life problem that every company faces in their lending operations. If the loan approval process is automated, it can save a lot of man-hours and improve the speed of service to the customers. The increase in customer satisfaction and savings in operational costs are significant” [9]. “However, the rewards can only be realized if the bank has a sturdy model in place to accurately forecast which client's loans it should accept and which it should reject, in order to reduce potential risk. Hence the primary aim of our paper is to minimize the risk present in approving the loan to the applicant. Therefore, by using the logistic regression analysis approach, the right customers to be targeted for granting loans can be easily detected by evaluating their likelihood of default on loan.

## CONCLUSION

In our logistic regression model, we have finally predicted whether the loan is approved or not. Through this research model, we had implemented a loan credibility prediction system that helps the organizations make the right decision to approve or reject the loan request of the customers. This will help the banking industry to open up efficient delivery channels. 

The observation inferred through this analysis is that the variable Credit History affects the chance of approval of a loan by a huge difference. The applicants with the Property Area as Sub-urban and the married applicants are more likely to get their loan approved. The accuracy of the predicted model is found to be 83.6%.
